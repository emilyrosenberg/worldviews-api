## Apps
The backend was created with 9 interconnected apps.
### Main app (drf_api)
This is the main app, which includes settings, URL paths, and authorization.
### Profiles
This app is for user profiles. The user can add a username, profile picture (avatar), and a bio.
### Followers
This app is for following other users. The number of followers/follows is counted on the user's profile.
### Posts
This app is for user-generated posts. The user can create a post with an image, title, and content. The date shows automatically.
### Comments
This app is for commenting on posts. The number of comments shows on the post.
### Likes
This app is for liking posts. The number of likes shows on the post.
### Plans
This app is for user-generated plans. The user can create a plan with a title, content, and location.
### Plan Comments
This app is for commenting on plans. The number of comments shows on the plan. It is the same as the comment app for posts, but this structure ensures that each comment shows under the correct content.
